# Analysis and Performance of Symbol Synchronization Techniques in Telecommunication Systems
This work presents implementations, analysis and comparison of symbol synchronization techniques in telecommunication systems, using the free software plataform GNU Octave.

## Getting Started

## Running the tests
 
## Analysis Already Completed
- Parameters variation with high signal-noise relation (mi, tau and Early-Late's samples);
- In Early-Late Decided, doesn't matter how many samples are inserted in synchronizator, because the way that the algorithm is written, with decided symbols, will always tend to synchronism;
- Samples per Symbol (sps) variation with high signal-noise relation.
